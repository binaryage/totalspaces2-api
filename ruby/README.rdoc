= TotalSpaces2 - Ruby API bindings for TotalSpaces2 from BinaryAge

== PRERELEASE: You can only use the API with versions 2.1 and above of TotalSpaces2.

Version 2.1+ of TotalSpaces2 is available by ticking the "Include pre-releases" checkbox in General Preferences and then selecting "Check for updates" from the menu.

This gem enables you to get information from and to control {TotalSpaces2}[link:http://totalspaces.binaryage.com]

It is the officially supported way of using the API library libtotalspaces2api, and the required dylib 
comes bundled with this gem. This gem uses {Ruby-FFI}[link:https://github.com/ffi/ffi] to call the functions in the dylib.
You'll need a sane ruby and compilation environment to install ruby-ffi - it probably won't install immediately with the
ruby that comes with Mavericks because none of the compilation tools are present. We use {homebrew}[link:http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/]
and {rbenv}[link:https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/] to manage our ruby scripting environment.

You may use this gem in various ways. For instance, you could:

* Display a message or alert when a particular space is moved to

* Automatically change the name of spaces depending on what apps are in them

* Record which spaces certain windows are on, and restoring those windows to those spaces when the owning app restarts

* Trigger moving certain windows between spaces

API support, and support for this gem starts with TotalSpaces2 v2.1 The API is a premium feature,
and will only work with registered versions of TotalSpaces2.
